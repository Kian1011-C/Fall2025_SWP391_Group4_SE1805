# 🔄 Change Log - Staff Assistance Feature

## 📅 Date: October 10, 2025

### 🎯 Task: Implement Staff Assistance Request for Battery Swap

## 🏁 Problem Solved
- User reported: "chọn trụ bị auto nhảy sang chọn trạm, phải lùi về mới ấn gửi yêu cầu từ nhân viên được"
- Issue: Staff assistance button only available in Step 1, but auto-navigation makes it hard to access

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Reusable Component
```javascript
const renderStaffAssistanceButton = (position = 'bottom') => {
  // Compact, reusable button component
  // Only shows when station is selected
  // Orange gradient design with animations
}
```

### 2. Added Button to ALL Steps
- ✅ Step 1: Chọn trạm sạc
- ✅ Step 2: Chọn trụ sạc  
- ✅ Step 3: Chọn pin mới
- ✅ Step 4: Chọn slot trống
- ✅ Step 5: Xác nhận đổi pin

### 3. Enhanced Modal System
- **State 1**: Confirmation with request details
- **State 2**: Loading spinner while sending
- **State 3**: Success notification with receipt

## 📝 Code Changes

### Files Modified:
1. `src/assets/js/services/swapService.js` - Added 4 new API methods
2. `src/pages/Driver/SwapBattery.jsx` - Major UI/UX improvements

### Key Functions Added:
- `requestStaffAssistance(assistanceData)`
- `handleRequestStaffAssistance()`
- `renderStaffAssistanceButton()`
- Complete modal system with 3 states

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### Before:
- ❌ Button only in Step 1
- ❌ Hard to access after auto-navigation
- ❌ User frustration

### After:
- ✅ Button available in ALL steps
- ✅ Compact, non-intrusive design
- ✅ Smooth user experience
- ✅ No need to navigate back

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Request Data Structure:
```javascript
{
  userId, userName, userPhone,
  vehicleId, vehiclePlate, vehicleModel,
  currentBatteryLevel, stationId, stationName,
  requestType: 'MANUAL_SWAP_ASSISTANCE',
  priority: 'HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW',
  note, requestedAt, contractId
}
```

### Priority Logic:
- Battery ≤ 10% → HIGH priority
- Battery ≤ 20% → MEDIUM priority  
- Battery > 20% → LOW priority

## ✨ User Experience Flow

1. **Select Station** → Staff button appears
2. **Navigate through steps** → Button always available
3. **Click assistance** → Modal opens
4. **Confirm request** → Loading → Success
5. **Wait for staff** → No need to stay in app

## 🚀 Result

**Problem Fixed:** ✅ Users can now request staff assistance from ANY step  
**User Satisfaction:** ✅ No more navigation frustration  
**Code Quality:** ✅ Reusable, maintainable components  
**UI/UX:** ✅ Consistent, beautiful design across all steps
